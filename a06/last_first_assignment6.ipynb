    "\n",
    "1. Fill in the code where indicated to complete the assignment. Feel free to add more cells than provided to try things out, and check what your variables look like, to see if you got the right results. Just make sure you have done what is asked for that question and that you don't delete any code we provide you with.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Rename this `last_first_assignment6.ipynb` file replacing `last` and `first` with your name. Make sure all the outputs are there (run each cell) and then export as `last_first_assignment6.py` as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Submit both these files to Quercus.\n",

    "## Questions and Support\n",
    "1. Please ask class content questions on the class GitHub page: \n",
    "https://github.com/BME1478H/Winter2020class/ Expect a processing time of 1d for us to respond. As such, we cannot guarantee we can address your questions and work through all the troubleshooting in time if you ask them the night before or the day of the assignment deadline. Please plan accordingly. \n",
    "2. Attend Wednesday Tutorial, 9-11am at UC140. We dedicate the 1st hour to anyone with questions primarily about the assignment coming up, as well as general content questions. We follow this up with 1H for going through the current week's lecture material.\n",
    "3. If there are sensitive questions, submit to BME1478h.ta.team@gmail.com, "
